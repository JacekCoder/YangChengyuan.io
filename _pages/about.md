Self Introduction
======

I'm a researcher focusing on **robotics & physical human–robot interaction (pHRI)**.  
My interests include **soft-belt human–robot interaction**, **MuJoCo** human-in-the-loop simulation, **soft-body modeling**, **ergonomics**, and the **DRBA** system.  
I'm currently based in **Singapore**.
